For this project, I will tackle a portfolio optimization problem. My plan is to first implement the classical Markowitz mean variance model in Python and then extend it by considering alternative penalty terms and constraint functions. In particular, I plan to compare an $\ell_1$ (sparsity) penalty, $\ell_2$ (ridge) penalty, and a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint against the classic model. In doing so, I will assume a constant expected returns model and attempt to minimize the variance (risk) of the portfolio. By back-testing on historical monthly returns, Iâ€™ll evaluate how each extension affects the efficient frontier, weight concentration, and tail-risk exposure. This project will display and deepen my understanding of quadratic programming, duality, and regularization schemes while allowing me to apply these ideas to real world concepts.
