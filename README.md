For this project, I will tackle a portfolio optimization problem. My plan is to first implement the classical Markowitz mean–variance model in Python and then extend it by considering alternative penalty terms and constraint functions. In particular, I plan to compare an L1 (sparsity) penalty, L2 (ridge) penalty, and a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint against the classic model. In doing so, I will assime a constant expected returns model and attempt to minimize the variance (risk) of the portfolio. By back-testing on historical monthly returns, I’ll evaluate how each extension affects the efficient frontier, weight concentration, and tail-risk exposure. This project will display and deepen my understanding of quadratic programming, duality, and regularization schemes while allowing me to apply these ideas to real world concepts.
